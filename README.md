This repo simulates an ATM UI and the bank account balance.

This app simulates the basic functions of an ATM UI. You can deposit and withdraw money. You access these transactions by selecting them in a dropdown menu.

Load into browser. 

# Description

This simulation is a project that uses React components. In particular this poject helps understand useState, onChange, onSubmit, and how to render objects on DOM. Some interesting functions: the app will validate if the deposit is real, i.e. you can't deposit a negative qty.
